When 'players' does not exist in the database (I deleted all players) and a new client arrives at the website, they generate TWO player records immediately. 
    The first only has a 'status' attribute set to 'disconnected'
    The second is as you would expect
    Has something to do with already being on the page when I press save in visual studio or refresh


When a player is removed, release their colour/alias so that other players can use them
